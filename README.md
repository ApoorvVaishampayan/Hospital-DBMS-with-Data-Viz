# Hospital Management System

## Overview

Welcome to the **Hospital Management System** project repository. This project is a comprehensive SQL-based database management system designed to revolutionize how hospitals handle patient data, streamline operations, and enhance patient care. Developed as part of an enterprise database management course, this system showcases the capabilities of relational databases in a healthcare setting.

## Features

### Database Design
- **Entity-Relationship Diagram**: Provides a logical view of the database structure.
- **Relational Diagram**: Offers a physical view of how tables are interconnected.
- **Tables**: Detailed SQL commands for creating and populating tables including `Department`, `Employee`, `Patient`, `LabTest`, and `PatientBill`.

### Data Management
- **Data Storage**: Efficiently stores patient, employee, department, and visit records.
- **Data Relationships**: Utilizes foreign keys to represent relationships between tables.

### Analytics and Reporting
- **SQL Queries**: Analytical queries to extract insights such as patient visit counts, total billing, preferred payment methods, and employee performance.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualization of key metrics using Python and Tableau.
  - **Python Visualization**: Interactive data exploration and visualization using Python.
  - **Tableau Dashboards**: Comprehensive dashboards for real-time data visualization.

### Deployment
- **AWS RDS**: Deployment on Amazon Web Services Relational Database Service for scalable and secure database management.
- **Data Security**: Ensures data privacy and compliance with healthcare regulations.

## Advantages

- **Streamlined Operations**: Combines scheduling, billing, inventory control, and patient information into a unified system.
- **Improved Patient Care**: Quick access to comprehensive patient records enhances decision-making and treatment outcomes.
- **Enhanced Communication**: Facilitates seamless data sharing among healthcare teams.
- **Efficient Scheduling**: Automated appointment scheduling reduces no-shows and optimizes resource utilization.
- **Accurate Billing**: Integrated billing modules streamline invoice generation and payment tracking.
- **Inventory Management**: Effective monitoring and management of hospital inventory to prevent stockouts and reduce waste.
- **Data Security**: Strict data security protocols protect sensitive patient data.
- **Decision Support**: Advanced reporting and analytics provide insights for strategic planning and quality improvement.
- **Remote Access**: Enables remote access to patient data and integrates with telemedicine services.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures adherence to healthcare regulations and standards.

## Use Cases

The system is adaptable beyond healthcare to various sectors including:
- **Pharmaceutical Industry**
- **Health Insurance Providers**
- **Education Sector**
